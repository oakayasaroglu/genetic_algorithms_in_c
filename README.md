# genetic_algorithms_in_c
Genetic algorithm project in C language

in this code we solve trader problem by using genetic algorithm

First of all, we determine the coordinates of the cities where the merchant should go and assign random routes to the merchant. We take the shortest 2 of these random routes and apply crossing over and mutation among themselves. if we've created a shorter route, we add it to the shortest routes and repeatedly crossing over and mutating. Detailed technical information is also available in the comment lines in the code.
